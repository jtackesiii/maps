### Yug Nirman Yojna Trust Press

There are actually two Gayatri Pariwar operated presses in Mathura. The smaller of the two, located across the street from the police checkpoint south of the Birla Mandir, is responsible for the publication of the _Akhaṇḍ Jyoti_ magazine, the headquarters of which are located in Giya Mandi, a neighborhood several kilometers south of the Gayatri Tapobhumi. The larger of the two presses lies on the plot immediately north of the Birla Mandir, and the grounds contain not only facilities for the publication and inventory of most of the organization's print materials, but also lodging for nearly five hundred pilgrims. A second residential structure is within a year of completion, which will double the number of visitors able to stay on the press grounds.

Until very recently, neither press location was visibly identifiable from the roadside, but a bright red signboard reading "Yug Nirman Yojna Trust" now stands outside the entrance of the larger press. Yet only those who already know of the organization and its publications are likely able to infer the Gayatri Pariwar from the name of the trust.
