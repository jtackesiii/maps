### Tapobhumi Lodgings

The southern half of the Tapobhumi complex is bordered by residential buildings. When asked about the housing capacity of these strucutres, Tapobhumi workers gave me figures ranging between 350 and 700. In all likelihood, the lower number most accurately reflects the number of people currently able to reside on the Tapobhumi grounds, for at least one of the residential halls was torn down in June in order to make room for the renovated temple area, part of a three-year project to renovate the Gayatri Tapobhumi. Even if a full 700 people were able to stay at the Tapobhumi at a given time, more space would be required for the influx of people during several celebrations, retreats, and workshops that take place there every year. Although there will never again be a 1000-_kuṇḍ mahāyajña_ in Mathura such as there was in 1958, which allegedly drew over 400,000 visitors in five days, it is not uncommon for annual and semi-annual functions to draw fifteen-hundred participants or more to the Tapobhumi grounds.^[In preparation for this immense function, eight semi-permanent "townships" were allegedly constructed on over three kilometers of land stretching northward along the Mathura-Vrindavan road from the Gayatri Tapobhumi, not including a 7 km<sup>2</sup> lot for the 1000 _havan kuṇds_ to be used in the ritual. See Lilapati Sharma, _Gurudev - Prophet of a New Era_ (Mathura: Yug Nirman Yojana Vistar Trust) 2009, 12-22.] On these occasions, guests are lodged at the Tapobhumi, at the nearby press, and in various dharmshalas in the area (including that of the Birla Mandir next-door to the press). Housing is free for those who stay in the Gayatri Pariwar's campuses, although prior registration is required. The tacit understanding, of course, is that visitors will donate a modest sum of money to the Gayatri Pariwar upon their departure.
