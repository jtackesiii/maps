### Vidyalaya

The northern portion of Gayatri Tapobhumi campus features a vocational school for secondary school boys. The course lasts ten months, from July to April, and includes subjects ranging from "moral education," ritual procedure, music, yoga, production of household goods (such as soap, incense, jam, etc.), computer courses, electronics, and press publication. For the duration of their studies, students are expected to live at the Gayatri Tapobhumi, and live according to its rules (daily morning _yajña_, vegetarian food -- no onions or garlic -- and alloted time for chanting and writing the Gayatri Mantra). During the time I spent at the Tapobhumi, there were twenty-four boys enrolled in the course, who stood out in appearance because of olive-green khaki uniforms that resembled police uniforms, quite different from the saffron kurtas and dhotis worn by the senior Gayatri Pariwar members.

Important to note is that the _vidyālaya_ stands alone on the northern edge of the Tapobhumi campus, and is off-limits to visitors (at least to foreign researchers). Even when invited by several students to view their classrooms on a Sunday afternoon, I was harshly scolded and led from the area by the Tapobhumi's security guard.
