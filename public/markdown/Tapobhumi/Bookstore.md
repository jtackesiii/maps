### Bookstore

As the Mathura Gayatri Pariwar is in charge of producing most of the organization's print publications, it makes sense that the Tapobhumi features an impressive bookstore where visitors can purchase them. Yet literature is not the extent of the items for sale: calendars, posters, bumper stickers, keychains, CDs, DVDs, and USB sticks contain excerpts or full recordings of Guru ji's lectures; worship items are for sale, including _mālā_ beads, pictures of Gayatri Devi, incense, _havan kuṇḍs_, wooden ladles to use with them, and even _havan samāgrī_ and ghee produced at the nearby printing press campus; Ayurvedic medicines are available for purchase, which I have been told are made at the Akhand Jyoti Press grounds. Clearly labeled metal aisles make browsing by subject an easy process, and freely distributed product catalogues (which also include a summarized history, timeline, and mission statement of the organization) are available to help the rare customer who would rather not ask the two or three receptionists sitting at any given time. The bookstore itself is three stories high, but only the first floor is open to customers. I imagine the upper stories are for storing extra inventory, whether for daily sales or for regularly demanded bulk orders.
