### Akhaṇḍ Jyoti Saṁsthān

The story goes that the founder of the Gayatri Pariwar, Shriram Sharma Acharya, came to Mathura in 1941, directed in visions by his guru in the Himalayas to establish an organizational headquarters in the city. His housing search brought him and his wife to the Giya Mandi neighborhood, where an old widow agreed to let them a 15-room three-story house for fifteen rupees per month. The catch, neighbors would only inform them after the papers had already been signed, was that the house was haunted by ghosts. This did not deter the two, and after a week of putting up with the late-night clamor of their ethereal company, Shriram Sharma struck a deal with them: you keep the seven rooms on the third story, and leave us to live peacefully in the remaining eight rooms.^[Lilapati Sharma, _Gurudev - Prophet of a New Era_ (Mathura: Yug Nirman Yojana Vistar Trust) 2009, 80-81.]

Shriram Sharma lived at this Giya Mandi residence until 1970, after which he and his wife left for Haridwar.^[Ibid, 110.] From that time until the present, their former home has served as the headquarters for the _Akhaṇḍ Jyoti_ magazine of the Gayatri Pariwar, which, according to the staff of the Gayatri Tapobhumi, has seventy thousand subscribers. Although the printing of the magazine takes place elsewhere (the press is located just south of the Birla Mandir, north of the Gayatri Tapobhumi), the editing work and subscriptions are all managed from Giya Mandi.

I have yet to inquire as to whether the upper rooms of the home are still the haunt of ghosts, but I know that the private quarters of Shriram Sharma and his wife have been kept largely intact: They serve largely as a museum exhibit to visitors curious about the history of the magazine. A wooden printing press stands in the corner of the room, allegedly the very same which was used to print the very first Mathura-based _Akhaṇḍ Jyoti_ issues.
