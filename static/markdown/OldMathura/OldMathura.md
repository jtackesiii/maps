### Old Mathura

I have labeled the dense jungle of neighborhoods extending west from the bathing _ghāṭs_ lining the Yamuna river to the eastern edge of the Mathura-Vrindavan road "Old Mathura." This designation is not entirely arbitrary; although archaeological digs even farther west than Govind Nagar evidence centuries-old structures throughout Mathura, development in those areas was disturbed during periods Mughal and British rule. Thus, the longest-standing residential and market areas of Mathura, as well as many of the city's oldest Hindu temple deities, reside in what I call "Old Mathura." Two of the city's longstanding influential caste groups, the Chaubes and the Yadavs, also inhabit designated neighborhoods in this area.^[For more information on these caste groups and their influence in Mathura, see Owen Lynch, "The Mastram: Emotion and Person Among Mathura's Chaubes" in _Divine Passions: The Social Construction of Emotion in India_ (Berkely: University of California Press) 1990, and Lucia Michelutti, "Sons of Krishna: the politics of Yadav community formation in a North Indian town" (PhD Thesis: London School of Economics and Political Science, Department of Social Anthropology) 2002.]

Locals, however, do not necessarily think of this as one zone. Following the cues of the city's rickshaw drivers, they are instead far more likely to refer to the destination points at the ends of the two major east-west roads that lead through these old neighborhoods: "Dwarkadish (Temple)" and "Holi Gate." For myself and my research, Old Mathura stands out as the "center" delineated by the city's Parikrama Marg, the site of the Gayatri Pariwar's Akhand Jyoti Samsthan, and the maze of narrow lanes that contain both a new one-room Brahma Kumaris center and a haveli owned for generations by one of Mathura's last _sanjhī kalākār_ families.^[Sanjhi is the art of paper stencil cutting, which was originally used to make rangolīs of the scenes of Krishna's _līlās_. These _rangolīs_ were often quite large, and many were crafted upon water rather than earth. Although freehand _rangolī_ has since become the norm, the paper stencils have found a new life as framed paper art: when tastefully paired with colorful background paper, these stencils closely resemble paintings. I befriended the youngest in this family practice, who agreed to teach me his trade in exchange for summary translations of Krishna's _līlās_ (so that he might more effectively explain them to English-speaking students during workshops).]
