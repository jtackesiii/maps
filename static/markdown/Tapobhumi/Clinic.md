### Medicial Clinic

Open since 2009, the Gayatri Tapobhumi's medical clinic provides consultations and treatments according to "every kind of '-pathy,'" from Ayurveda, allopathy, homeopathy, physiotherapy, the yoga, naturopathy, and magnetic therapy (as well as dental, eye, and ENT care). There is a resident doctor for each of these medical specialties except for an eye doctor (who left Mathura a few months back) and an ENT doctor (which there had never been since the clinic's opening). There used to have been a pathology ward as well, but because of a botched treatment, the ward had since closed at the request of the Tapobhumi administration. With its own streetside entrance, the Tapobhumi Chikitsalaya offers its services to the local community on a "no profit, no loss" model. According to the in-charge of the clinic, an average of 200-250 patients visit every day.

The medicines available at the Chikitsalaya are sourced differently. Allopathic and naturopathic medicines are not stocked at the clinic. In the case of allopathy, prescription slips are given to patients who can visit local pharmacies, and in the case of naturopathy, the medicines are nothing but items freely attainable in nature: water, air, soil, etc. Homeopathic medicines are bought from local retailers, and the Ayurvedic remedies are manufactured by the Gayatri Pariwar itself, presumably at the _Akhaṇḍ Jyoti_ Press.^[I say presumably because I have not in fact seen where they are manufactured. The in-charge of the clinic told me they are manufactured at the press, and the manager of the main press campus said that no such Ayurvedic medicines were produced under his watch -- he conjectured that they must be produced at the nearby _Akhaṇḍ Jyoti_ Press.] Although many of these Ayurvedic medicines are available all year, some are seasonally manufactured, such as the Gayatri Tapobhumi's Chyawanprash which is sold at the bookstore during the winter months.
