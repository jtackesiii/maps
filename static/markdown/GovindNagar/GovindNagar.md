### Govind Nagar

I live in Govind Nagar, a bustling neighborhood that reflects Mathura's status as a pilgrimage city. Many of the shops and roadside carts sell items identifiable to Hindus as _sr̥ṁgāra_, pertaining to the ornamentation of household shrines and deities. From east to west, the main artery of Govind Nagar connects the Mathura-Vrindavan road to the residential gully that leads to gate three of the Krishna Janmsthan, the dirt road that culminates at the Jawahar Vidyalaya Inter College, the southbound street to the Potra Kund (along the way offering a market alleyway that takes one to the Janmsthan's gate number two), and the northwestern continuation of Mathura's _parikrama mārg_ (which passes by the _rāmlīlā maidān_ before bending east). This east-west road is habitually clogged with tour buses, which arrive from Gujarat, West Bengal, Rajasthan, and, of course, Delhi, ferrying the pilgrims who will exacerbate the congestion by their foot traffic to and from the Janmsthan. For the majority of my time in Govind Nagar, a beige haze floated in the air, no doubt the consequence of traffic upon several unpaved roads, frequent road construction (repairs to the neighborhood's sewer lines), and toxic exhaust belched from the oldest generations of tour buses passing through.

Several sounds and smells characterize Govind Nagar. Although they roam the area in full force during the day, choruses of barking dogs and screeching monkeys often choose the third watch for their vocal performances. Their whoops and shouts are only rivaled by the clamor of wedding celebrations, and processions that emanate from Hotel Greenland, on the main road. The sunlit hours are instead filled with vehicle horns and the shrill whistles of plastic pan flutes, sold as souvenirs to pilgrims by eager peddlers on the roadside. A large number of cows lazily wander the side streets and even the main road, and younger ones occasionally announce their right of way in tones that rival those of the scooters and rickshaws. These bovine residents contribute a barnyard scent to the air, which otherwise stings of vehicle exhaust and the occasional whiff of an open sewer. A single-gauge railway track connects the Krishna Janmsthan to Vrindavan, and this track passes right through the eastern edge of Govind Nagar. Once in a blue moon, the "toot" of an ambling single-car passenger train will compete with the vehicles waiting to cross the tracks. Otherwise, this rail line is the territory of bleating goats and donkeys being led to and from the Shahi Idgah. For all of this hubub, there are several quite peaceful hours of the morning when you can hear the birds sing, joined for a verse or two by a passing vegetable seller as he raises his cry.
