### Govardhan Puja Mela

The evening after Diwali, Govind Nagar celebrates the _annakūṭ_ ("mountain of food") festival, otherwise called Govardhan Puja, with largesse: Krishna as _giridhārī_, or the "mountain-lifter," is rendered in cow dung on a massive scale (over 2000 ft<sup>2</sup>). Barricaded on four sides by tables hung with posters, in the manner of an urban ice rink, Krishna may be the central attraction, but he is not the only one. Just past Mount Govardhan, which is held up by Krishna's left hand (some say by just his little finger), a temporary temple has been erected, brimming with nothing other than a mountain of food -- a literal hill of rice surrounded by vegetables and sweets of all sorts. Further still, a stage with live musicians provides festive _dhol_ and harmonium rhythms to the bustling locals and pilgrims. At Krishna's feet, an inflatable slide, a far-too-rapidly spinning Ferris wheel, and a row of toy vendors prompt children to beggar their parents for play. A long line leads to free food set out on serve-yourself tables along Krishna's left flank, and this food is _prasād_, having been offered to Krishna during the afternoon _pūjā_.

The event is quite the sight. But how is it funded? Who organizes it? Reports from locals suggest that it is a neighborhood-sponsored event, for volunteers had made door-to-door rounds throughout Govind Nagar to collect the money necessary for the festival. One gentleman, staring wistfully toward the _melā_ from a popular tea stall on the main road, speculated that the enterprising individual who organized the fundraising efforts may well have skimmed some profit from the top of the donation pool -- there would have been no shortage of money. As if to assure me that he would never dream of such embezzlement, this man declared that honest people would use excess donations to buy and distribute free toys to the children. I cannot but wonder if that was wishful thinking on the part of a parent whose generosity recently left a toy-sized hole in his wallet.
