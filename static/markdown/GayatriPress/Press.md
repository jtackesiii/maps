The press facility is a four-story building and houses the production of most of the Gayatri Pariwar's print materials, as well as a few other items such as _havan samāgrī_. The organization of the building reflects the publication process: materials are printed on the ground floor, bound on the second floor, and inventoried on the third and fourth floors. The third floor is also where inventoried items are packaged for distribution. Although every employee operating machinery was male, several female employees sat on the second floor collating printed materials for binding and sorting bound materials for storage and/or packaging.

The _havan samāgrī_ is processed on the ground floor, further back than the printing facilities. The room where it happens is filled with gunny sacks, some with unprocessed seeds, leaves, and nuts, and others with the finely-ground _sāmagrī_ for use in daily _yajña_. Aside from these sacks, two large mechanical apparatuses fill the space. The first extends the length of the far side of the room: a hole in the ground allows a conveyor belt to carry unprocessed mulch into a grinder, which then deposits the mixture into a large basin attached to a piston that shakes the basin so that the _samāgrī_ is evenly distributed.

A second machine either grinds the herbs further or filters them in some way. Four workers, all men, operate the machinery. Two shoveled loose mulch onto the conveyor belt, one sat by the basin ensuring that the processing went smoothly, and a fourth used a power tool that to seal the gunny sacks filled with processed _sāmagrī_.
