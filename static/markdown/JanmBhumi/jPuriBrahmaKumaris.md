### Brahma Kumaris Center

I have been repeatedly told that this is the "main" center of the Brahma Kumaris in Mathura, despite the fact that it is not as well-connected to the bureaucratic network of the Brahma Kumaris as other local chapters. For example, when I sought a way to officialize my participation in one of several conferences at Mount Abu, I tried, as is the norm, to do so through the local branch with which I am most closely affiliated. It is quite common for these local centers to organize group trips, designating "guides" who accompany first-timers so that their journey includes minimal hiccups. When I asked Suman Didi, the in-charge of the Potra Kund center, to help me arrange my trip, she told me that the system for organizing group trips to Mount Abu was still in progress, and she recommended instead that I seek permission to attend through the New Delhi chapter which I had told her I had visited on several occasions before. When I arrived at Mount Abu for the conference, I was shocked to meet -- completely by chance -- the guide sent by Mathura's Refinery Township Brahma Kumaris center.

This is one example of how Mathura's "main" Brahma Kumaris center is somewhat isolated both from the rest of the city's Brahma Kumaris chapters and the Mount Abu headquarters. The other most relevant example of this distance is how Suman Didi explicates the morning _murl朝_ compared to other Brahma Kumaris. A woman in her sixties, Suman Didi is proud of the experience she has earned from a lifetime of Brahma Kumaris practice. If her experience has taught her one thing, it is that time is short: her _murl朝s_ are often succinct, dwelling on the millenarian message of the organization's early years, without delving into the practical lifestyle advice commonly found in the lectures given by TV personalities such as BK Shivani. The relatively somber message that Suman Didi reads out of many of the morning readings places a large emphasis on personal discipline, which is immediately observable in the post-_murl朝_ cleaning sessions, when all of the BK women sweep the meditation hall, affording one of the men to write a summarized version of the day's _murl朝_ on a white board in the entry room.
